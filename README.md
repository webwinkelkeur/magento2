# Webwinkelkeur for Magento® 2

The WebwinkelKeur Connect extension allows seamless integration of your Magento® 2 store with your WebwinkelKeur account. The WebwinkelKeur Foundation is a non-profit Dutch organisation. 

For members of WebwinkelKeur this extension allows the integration of the innovative WebwinkelKeur Sidebar which increases the overall conversion of the webshop.
